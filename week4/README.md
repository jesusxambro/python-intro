Happy Monday Class!



This week's deliverables are for Friday, 21 February at the end of the day.

Items Due:
Ch 4: Lab, Quiz, Practice


This upcoming session will be the Exam 1. It will be aprroximately 2 hours to complete using the Lockdown Browser. You can download it here: https://instruction.austincc.edu/students/article/respondus-lockdown-browser/

I highly suggest installing it before the exam day. You will only see the exam inside the lockdown browser and not outside of it. There are no notes, other programs, or any outside help with content. If you have technical difficulties, the link has support information.


Here is a link to a Google Drive folder of the files used during last week's class:
